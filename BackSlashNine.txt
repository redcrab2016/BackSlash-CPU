    sxxxxxxx: immediate signed from -128 to +127

111 sss iiiiiiiiii : Immediate assign to register R0 (no flag modified), always execute (no ccc conditional execution)
    AR0 : assign to regiter R0, R0 = iiiiiiiiii << sss : i = 0 to 1023, s from 0 to 7

Branching is done by having destination register R15 (PC) (any instruction is valid, but CPY is prefered for absolute branching and JMP for relative small branching (with CPY and JMP, R15 is saved in R11 before R15 changement)
At CPU reset all registers are set to zero (except R13, always with value 1), first instruction at address 0
when R15 (PC) is 0xFFFF the instruction at 0xFFFF is not executed and the CPU halt. (Address 0xFFFF can be use for data but not for instruction)
Register R15 (PC) designate the next instruction to execute.
