BackSlash 9 : RISC full 16 bits only, each address does represent a 16 bits value in memory, 64Kili addresses for a total memory of 128 KiB
16 registers
R0  : General (e.g compute) 
R1  : General (e.g compute) 
R2  : General (e.g compute) 
R3  : General (e.g compute) 
R4  : General (e.g temporary)
R5  : General (e.g temporary)
R6  : General (e.g temporary)
R7  : General (e.g temporary)
R8  : General (e.g address)
R9  : General (e.g address)
R10 : General (e.g address)
R11 : General (e.g address)
R12 : Zero (always value 0)
R13 : One ( always value 1)
R14 : Flag ( ____  SOZC) S sign, O signed overflow, Z zero, C carry
R15 : Porgram counter

16 bits intruction, CPY, ADD, SUB, NOT, AND, OR, SHL, SHR, AR0
ccc ooo mm xxxx yyyy
xxxx : register destination
yyyy : register source
mm : register or memory adress referenced by register 
    00 : xxxx destination register, yyyy source register  ( from register to register)
    01 : xxxx destination register, yyyy source register for memory address (from memory to register)
    10 : xxxx destination register for memory address, yyyy source register  (from register to memory)
    11 : xxxx destination register for memory address, yyyy source register for memory address (from memory to memory)
ooo : instruction (modify flag, except CPY and AR0)
    000 : CPY, copy data from source to destination, does not modify flag
    001 : ADD, destination = destination + source
    010 : SUB, destination = destination - source
    011 : NOT, destination = !source
    100 : AND, destination = destination & source
    101 : OR, destination = destination | source
    110 : SHL, destination = destination << source
    111 : SHR, destination = destination >> source
ccc : condition to execute the instruction
    000 : al, always
    001 : cs, if 'C' Carry flag set  (when result of ADD/SUB is below/above of before execution of destination value), when last evacuated bit by SHL/SHR is one
    010 : cc, if 'C' Carry flag clear (when result of ADD/SUB is above/below of before execution of destination value), when last evacuated bit by SHL/SHR is zero
    011 : zs, if 'Z' Zero flag set ( using SUB as comparator, before execution source equal destination), when result of instruction is equal to zero
    100 : zc, if 'Z' Zero flag clear (using SUB as comparator, before execution source is not equal to destination), when result of instruction is not equal to zero
    101 : ab, if above ( using SUB as comparator, before execution destination is above source, )
    110 : be, if below ( using SUB as comparator, before execution destination is below source)
    111, not a condition : marker for immediate assign

111 sss ii iiii iiii : Immediate assign to register R0 ( not flag modified)
    AR0 : assign to regiter R0, R0 =   iiiiiiiiii << sss : i = 0 to 1023, s from 0 to 7

Branching is done by having destination register R15 (any instruction is valid, but CPY is prefered)
At CPU reset all register is set to zero (except R13, always with value 1), first instruction at address 0
